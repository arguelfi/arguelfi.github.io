# Career Summary
## *Scanbots, Warsaw, Poland* **Oct 2017-Aug 2018**
### Tech Lead
Scanbots’ goal was to make use of long-range drones for the monitoring of linear infrastructures, 
such as Electrical Networks, Oil & Gas Pipes, roads, etc.
By integrating with state-of-the-art Drone manufacturers, Scanbots developed the software that integrated 
multiple sensors like Photo, thermal, near-infrared cameras and a LiDAR; GPS & IMUs for accurate spatial localisation.
Such data needed to be sanitized, filtered, analyzed and exposed to clients. 
We developed a platform based in micro-services that would import, correlate, expose and export all data whilst storing
it in a secure way.
GIS technologies like PostGIS, GDAL, Leaflet.js, OpenSeaDragon and Potree were put in place to display images 
and point cloud data online.
The platform's goal was to become the input to a Semi-supervised learning algorithm that would eventually find
anomalies in images automatically, thanks to computer vision & machine learning techniques.
